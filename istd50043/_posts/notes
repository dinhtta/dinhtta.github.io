\beta-bound adversary -> mining power


1. Decker et al. -> effective mining power depends on propagation delays
    Why Bitcoin isn't 50% tolerant, but 49.1 

2. Asymmetrical reward: selfish mining
    -> maximizing relative rewards to lure honest miner
    -> adversary still minority, but induces conflict whenever it has advantage
    -> algorithms:
    -> \alpha and \gamma effect the relative revenues

2.5. Digression on rational players vs. simple honest/malicious dichotomy

3. Bitcoin in synchronous setting  
  -> propagation delay = 0
  -> Bitcoin backbone protocol:
        f = block interval
        \alpha
        \beta
  -> desynchronized: increase f
  -> common prefix, chain quality
  -> key idea behind: unique successful round to force adversary to generate even more block -> impossible
  -> results:
        \alpha, \beta
  -> meaning
      + small f -> bound of \beta
      + large f (delay / high rate) -> bound on \beta -> 0
      + graph

4. Bitcoin in bounded-delay/partial synchrony model:
  -> extending theorem with \delta
  -> both f*\delta need to be small

5. More quantitative model (Gervais) that quantifies impacts of various parameters on selfish mining attacks
  -> some real measurements of Bitcoin, ETH and other PoW variants
  -> same conclusion as 3,4:
      + propagation delay effects stale block rates -> security
      + block interval effects stale block -> security
  -> new:
      + blocksize increases propagation delay *linearly*, then *exponentially*
      => there should be a cap
