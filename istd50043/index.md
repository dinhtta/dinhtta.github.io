## Course Description
Database systems manage data which is at the heart of modern computing applications. We are in the era of big
data, in which data is generated from many sources, in high velocity, and in high variety. This era presents  
numerous challenges in using and improving database technologies. Big data systems designed to support
analytics are maturing and are becoming increasingly important to many applications.

This course covers the fundamentals of traditional databases, such as Oracle and MySQL, and core ideas of
recent big data systems. Students will learn important problems in data management that these systems are
designed to solve. They will experience with building applications on top of traditional databases, namely
MySQL, and state‐of‐the‐art big data platforms, namely MongoDB and Apache Spark. These systems will be
running both locally and on the Amazon cloud (Amazon Web Service). The students will be able to determine the
advantages and disadvantages of different systems.
