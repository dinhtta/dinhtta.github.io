I am a senior lecturer (cyber security) at Deakin University.  Previously I was a tenure-track faculty at the Singapore
University of Technology and Design, in the Information System and Technology Design (ISTD) pillar. I am interested in
performance and security aspects of distributed systems (including blockchains, databases, and cloud-native systems).  I
am a recipient of VLDB 2019's best paper award, and MM'15 best paper runner up award. I serve as associate editor of
VLDB 2024, and am a regular PC member of SIGMOD, ICDE, SoCC, NDSS.
