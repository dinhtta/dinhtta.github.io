My full name, in Vietnamese, is Dinh Tien Tuan Anh. In research publication, I go by the name "Tien Tuan Anh Dinh". In
life, people call me Anh. 

I am currently a faculty at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, in the Information System and
Technology Design (ISTD) pillar. My research lies at the intersection of distributed systems, databases and
security. I am interested in building and applying security primitives, either based on cryptography or
trusted hardware, to improve both security and performance of large scale systems. My PhD was in applying
formal methods to verify security properties of P2P systems. My latest interest is centered around
blockchains. 

Prior to this, I was a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS), working with
[Professor Ooi Beng Chin](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooibc) on databases and security. Before that, I was a research fellow at Nanyang
Technological University (NTU), also in Singapore, working with [Professor Anwitaman
Datta](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/anwitaman) and cloud-based
systems. I spent few months at Singtel as a research engineer. I also spent four months at Microsoft Research
in the networking and systems group. I got my PhD from the University of Birmingham, UK, under the supervision
of [Professor Mark Ryan](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr).
